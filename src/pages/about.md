One thing I've learned in life is that finding what makes you happy takes determination. And it's not as much about finding who you are and want you truly want, as much finding out who you are not and what you don't want, by process of elimination. One must do this with eagerness, discipline, and a hunger to experience. Let's face it, we need to experience things to truly determine what we enjoy and who we want to become. But more importantly we need those experiences so we can rule out who are not.
